# Domain-private-Factor-Detachment-Network
We propose a novel Domain-private Factor Detachment (DFD) network to disentangle domain-dependent factors and achieve identity information distillation. Our approach consists of three key components, including Domain-identity Representation Learning (DiRL), Cross-domain Factor Detachment (CdFD) and Cross-domain Aggregation Learning (CAL).
